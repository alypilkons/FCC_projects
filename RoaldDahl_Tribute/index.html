            <p class="text-center">Roald Dahl was a screenwriter, poet, and fighter pilot, but he is probably best known for his children's books, which include <em>Matilda</em>, <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, <em>James and the Giant Peach</em>, and <em>The Witches</em>. His writing has been adapted into movies, television shows, and even a musical, and his books have entertained and influenced millions of children and still do today, almost thirty years after his death in 1990.
